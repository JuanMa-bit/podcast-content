However, consistently interpreting our partner\u2019s behavior as a personal attack or a reflection on us can become problematic in long-term romantic relationships because we have so many interactions to navigate.

Is it me, or was there something about your day that felt tough that you\u2019d like to talk about?\u201d You sought clarification in just a straightforward sentence and inclusively engaged your partner.",

                    "-",
                    "Another option is to deal with the moment through self-soothing, self-validation, and perspective-taking. You may seek a more compassionate view. You might know your partner has been dealing with a challenging work project, which can help you extend some grace. Sometimes, you might not be able to let go of the belief that it was an intentional dig from your partner. In such instances, it\u2019s essential to recognize and address your frustration. Try saying, \u201cI found what my partner said hurtful, yet I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s significant enough to discuss further or seek additional reassurance.\u201d Learning to value and comfort yourself when hurt is crucial for nurturing relationships.",
                    "Let them know that they impacted you.",
                    "-",
                    "Understandably, you will experience moments when it does feel important to let your partner know they\u2019ve hurt you or that you feel misunderstood. However, it isn\u2019t helpful to go into either defense mode or launch a counter-attack that will likely put them on the defensive. Instead, it can help to address the issue promptly (not five weeks later) by expressing how their actions affected you. Think of those \u201cI-statements\u201d that take the format of \u201cI felt X (specific emotion) when you did Y (specific action) in Z situation (specific context).\u201d Your partner may not respond ideally, but you increase your chances of being heard if you share that way rather than hurling back, \u201cWhat the hell was that look for?!?\u201d",
                    "These strategies won\u2019t immediately erase your natural tendency to take things personally. However, they can help slow your reactions, promoting greater understanding and effectiveness as a partner. We often perceive events as centered around us due to our immersion in personal experiences. However, recognizing that our partners have their own unique lives, influenced by many factors not related to us, can significantly improve our relationships."

                    "Walk the line between overreacting and underreacting.",
                    "Posted November 17, 2020 Reviewed by Abigail Fagan",
                    "Every one of us has a tender underbelly of our psyche. Everyone has something they\u2019re sensitive about, where even a gentle poke can feel more like a thwack. Comments don\u2019t slide off like water from a duck\u2019s back; rather, we feel more like a sitting duck.",
                    "But criticism is an inevitable part of life, and hearing reasonable negative feedback without overreacting is a life skill. If we can hear fair criticism of our actions without taking it personally, not only do we escape feeling hurt or shamed, we also keep criticism from escalating. By contrast, if we think, \u201cYou hurt my feelings so I\u2019ll hurt you back,\u201d we create more conflict and pain all around.",
                    "So how can we take things less personally, both to benefit ourselves and others? How can we toughen up without becoming hard-hearted?",
                    "Let\u2019s start with two tips about how to re-interpret the critic, whether it\u2019s your boss, your mother-in-law, your nosy neighbor, or someone you love and trust. In fact, that\u2019s the crux of the matter.",
                    "1. Consider the source.",
                    "Would you be as likely to drink water from a mountain spring as from a puddle under a dumpster? Of course not. But why? Aside from the fact that you are smart, it\u2019s because the source matters.",
                    "The same thing goes for criticism. Does the critique come from someone you like and respect? Does this person know you well? Or is this someone known to shoot off their mouth, have all the subtlety of a sledgehammer, or has never had an authentic interaction with you?",
                    "In short, you\u2019d take criticism very differently if it was presented with care from someone you trust versus shouted from a moving car. Consider the source, which will help you decide whether to take their feedback to heart or with a big grain of salt.",
                    "2. Give critics another chance, but not unlimited chances.",
                    "People say mean things. People can be dumb. People have no filter. It\u2019s only human to make a mistake and say something critical or insulting, but if it happens again and again, it\u2019s not a mistake anymore, it\u2019s a pattern.",
                    "To paraphrase, critique me once, that\u2019s on you. Critique me twice, that\u2019s on me. But if you\u2019re repeatedly insulted without apology or acknowledgment, it\u2019s time to speak up and/or limit contact. Three strikes and you\u2019re not necessarily out, especially if you still have to work with or be related to them, but it\u2019s definitely time to draw some boundaries.",
                    "Next up, four tips about how to work on ourselves to take the sting out of criticism. As they say, the only person you can change is you.",
                    "3. Heed the double-edged sword of \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t say that!\u201d",
                    "Individuals hypersensitive to criticism often have high moral standards. They have a strict moral code and their values run deep. And that\u2019s a good thing. But this is one of the few places where strong values can have a downside. \u201cHow dare they say that!\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s wrong!\u201d \u201cShe can\u2019t say that!\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s not how things should be.\u201d All those things may be true, but whatever statement hurt you was still uttered.",
                    "The fact that the critic \u201cshouldn\u2019t\u201d or \u201ccan\u2019t\u201d is moot. Pretend a dog just deposited a steaming bundle right next to your \u201cplease pick up after your pet\u201d sign. It shouldn\u2019t have happened, but you have to deal with it nonetheless.",
                    "Getting unfair or undue criticism is similar. Even if it \u201cshouldn\u2019t\u201d be there, you still have to deal with it. Feeling annoyed and offended may be warranted, but it\u2019s not helpful. Remember that even if you walk the line and follow the rules, you can\u2019t control whether others break them. In short, focus your attention on the content of the criticism, not whether or not it should have happened.",
                    "4. Question your own perfectionism.",
                    "There is a straight line between hypersensitivity and perfectionism. Individuals who take things personally often work really hard to be blameless, flawless, or excellent precisely so no one will criticize them. When they get negative feedback, it feels like it blows away all they\u2019ve worked so hard for.",
                    "If this sounds familiar, you can reframe this in a few ways. One is to incorporate getting better at hearing criticism into your perfectionism. Get better at receiving feedback. Aim higher when it comes to dealing with commentary. Be an overachiever when it comes to facing the haters.",
                    "Another, more challenging way, is to change your perfectionism. Dare to accept your cracks and warts. Slowly realizing that you are enough just as you are takes time and work, but simply acknowledging your buttons can be a powerful first step. If you were bullied in the past, you may be hypersensitive to comments that remind you of being thrown against your middle school locker. If you were pigeonholed by your parents as being the dumb one, the crazy one, or the problem child, you may have worked your butt off to prove that you\u2019re anything but.",
                    "Any critique that brings forth old hurts cuts extra deep, but just being aware that something is a hot button issue for you is the first step to owning it, and eventually healing it.",
                    "5. \u201cI should\u2019ve said\u2026!\u201d Be honest with yourself when recreating scenes in your head.",
                    "We\u2019ve all experienced getting bullied or criticized and then, hours later, coming up with a good zinger we wish we had said in the moment. We replay the scene in our head, spinning out what we wanted to have happened instead of what actually went down.",
                    "But replaying scenes in your head is a two-sided coin. In some cases, it can be extremely helpful. If you replay the scene and imagine getting what you needed in the moment\u2014feeling empowered, soothed, or safe, it can be an extremely worthwhile daydream. In fact, when done with a qualified therapist, this is called imagery rescripting, and is a cutting-edge tool in treating trauma survivors.",
                    "However, in other cases replaying a scene can be problematic; specifically, imagining revenge fantasies. At that point, reimagining crosses the line from empowering to egotistical.",
                    "In fact, a study out of Louisiana State University found a link between how frequently people re-imagined interactions and covert narcissism, the version of narcissism associated with low self-esteem rather than I-am-the-greatest grandiosity. Covert narcissism is the unenviable mix of being vulnerable and self-absorbed at the same time.",
                    "The researchers found that frequently imagining scenes that were discrepant with reality\u2014fantasizing about humiliating the ex you never see anymore, or imagining dressing down your boss and staging a power grab\u2014was tied to covert narcissism. Turns out covert narcissists envision conflict more often than non-narcissists and, in addition, imagine themselves dominating the interaction and controlling the relationship.",
                    "So be aware when you replay those scenes in your head. If you\u2019re doing it to soothe and empower yourself, carry on. But if you\u2019re doing it to dominate your imagined enemy, consider trying out a healthier coping strategy instead.",
                    "6. Toe the line between taking things personally and being personally invested.",
                    "To wrap things up, we\u2019ll do something surprising: we\u2019ll defend taking things personally. Now, \u201ctaking things personally\u201d usually brings to mind images of silent fuming or screaming into our pillow, but there\u2019s something to be said for taking things to heart.",
                    "The opposite of taking things personally is to depersonalize them. And when you depersonalize an action or a role, it quickly loses its value. Taking your job personally means being invested, while depersonalizing it means showing up only for a paycheck. Taking a passion personally means being engaged, while detaching guarantees lackluster results at best.",
                    "To take things even further, with your fellow humans, taking things personally means engaging with others at your best. Not taking things personally, at worst, leads to dehumanization and moral disengagement\u2014convincing yourself that ethical standards and other people don\u2019t matter.",
                    "So, oddly, let things get to you. Take them personally, in the best possible way. Find a happy medium between being hypersensitive and caring deeply. All in all, take your work and relationships extremely personally. After all, this messy, imperfect, glorious life of yours belongs to you.",

                    "I\u2019d be rich by now.",
                    "When I quit my corporate job in Paris and took a year off traveling people would often ask me, \u201cSo, what\u2019s your plan now?\u201d A normal question to ask, I know. But back then, I usually got offended by that question and other follow-up ones. It made me think that others were judging my decision and questioning my ability to change career paths.",
                    "Or when I was single and people would ask, \u201cSo, are you seeing anyone right now?\u201d Again, I\u2019d often assume that they thought less of me if I didn\u2019t have an interesting single life or wasn\u2019t dating someone special.",
                    "Or in the early days of dating my boyfriend, when he wouldn\u2019t have time to talk or see me at times, I\u2019d take it personally and assume the worst. Maybe I had done something to mess everything up. Maybe he didn\u2019t think I was that interesting after all.",
                    "Taking things personally is emotionally draining. It often makes you assume the worst and puts you into the victim corner. Sometimes, of course, it\u2019s worth reflecting on our own behavior, which can help us develop and grow as individuals. But taking things personally, when many times they\u2019re not, just tears down our self-esteem and makes us question ourselves.",
                    "Here are a few ways to stop taking things personally:",
                    "1. Question your negative beliefs.",
                    "When we take things personally, it\u2019s often because we hold a negative belief that is fueling our perception of a situation. For example, if you say \u201chello\u201d to an acquaintance on the street and get upset because they don\u2019t reply back, you might believe that people who don\u2019t acknowledge you are rude or that they have something against you.",
                    "Look at the limiting belief behind the situation and question it. Maybe they didn\u2019t actually see you. Maybe they didn\u2019t have time to perceive that it was you who passed by. Or maybe they were simply too occupied in their own mind to engage with anyone else.",
                    "Many times, our beliefs make us misinterpret situations negatively and turn them against ourselves. We form negative assumptions and inevitably feel hurt if we don\u2019t take the time to question our thoughts and beliefs.",
                    "2. Don\u2019t assume you know everything.",
                    "When I left my job to travel for a year and get clear on what business to start, I was scared of what others, especially colleagues I respected, would think of me. I simply assumed that they would think I was irresponsible for leaving a good career for\u2026 well, I didn\u2019t know yet.",
                    "There was one colleague in particular, who I really looked up to, that I already had assumed judged me for my decision. Whenever she mentioned something about her career, I turned that against myself as a way of confirming \u201cI knew it, she thinks I\u2019ve made a terrible mistake.\u201d",
                    "Then one day, when we were talking about my journey and the choices I had made, she said, \u201cYou know Maria, I think you\u2019re so brave. I wish I had the courage to also quit and pursue my own business.\u201d This proved to me that we don\u2019t know what others are thinking about us, even if we think we do. So don\u2019t assume you know everything.",
                    "3. Know that it\u2019s not about you.",
                    "When someone seems harsh or insensitive it\u2019s easy to assume it\u2019s personal. But often, it\u2019s really not. Someone who\u2019s rude to you in traffic might have had a terrible morning. Someone who makes a condescending comment might struggle with their own self-esteem and self-confidence. Someone who\u2019s cold and short in their communication might be really stressed.",
                    "It\u2019s worth reflecting on what we can learn when it comes to things we take personally. In my experience, there\u2019s always a lesson. Try to extract it and then leave the rest.",
                    "For example, when I started a podcast, a friend sent me a picture over Instagram with the message \u201cWomen doing podcasts just found a substitute for therapy.\u201d It was supposed to be funny, but it wasn\u2019t to me.",
                    "My learning in that situation was to care more about what I wanted to do instead of one other person\u2019s opinion (or joke). (And I\u2019m happy I\u2019ve continued because, since then, we\u2019ve received so much positive feedback on the podcast!)",
                    "4. Create a counter-story.",
                    "Often, when we take something personally, it\u2019s because it confirms a negative story we have running in the back of our mind. For example, if someone in your family makes a joke or comment about you being messy or having limited cooking skills\u2014and you regularly tell yourself that you\u2019re somehow inferior to others because of these things\u2014you might get offended.",
                    "So, what should you do? Create an empowering counter story. Maybe you\u2019re a bit messy, but so what? You might also be really creative. And maybe you\u2019re not so great at cooking, but you have other skills\u2014for example, you\u2019re the one who always sorts out conflicts between people.",
                    "In short, tell a story that benefits you and remember that we all have flaws, quirks, imperfections, and weaknesses. Needless to say, if you don\u2019t like your behavior, then of course, you have the power to change it. But sometimes you simply need to accept that you are who you are, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that.",
                    "5. Accept that we\u2019re all different (and not everyone needs to like you).",
                    "You might be taking something personally because this gives you a greater chance of getting someone\u2019s approval. If it\u2019s about you, then there\u2019s something you can do about it. If it\u2019s about them, then it\u2019s truly out of your hands, and all you can do is accept that, for whatever reason, they don\u2019t like you or won\u2019t let you in.",
                    "No single person on this planet is liked by everyone. That\u2019s just part of life, for all of us. Instead of trying to change yourself to be liked by someone, shift your focus and ask yourself why you need this person\u2019s approval. Is it that you\u2019re uncomfortable with disapproval in general, or do you want them to like you for other reasons, such as they are a friend of a friend?",
                    "When you identify the root cause of your discomfort with their disapproval, you\u2019ll be able to tell yourself what you need to hear to let it go\u2014for example, that their opinion doesn\u2019t mean anything about you as a person.",
                    "6. Create space between an \u201coffense\u201d and your reaction.",
                    "When we take something personally, it\u2019s easy to lash out in anger, frustration, or pain, which only makes things worse. Before you step into action, try creating some space between the situation and your reaction. Breathe, step away, and allow yourself to calm down before acting out.",
                    "Maybe you interpreted the situation in a negative way. Maybe this person wasn\u2019t judging or being condescending toward you. Maybe there\u2019s something you don\u2019t know about the situation. Try not to react to the situation, but to respond once you have calmed down. Perhaps with a little time and space you\u2019ll recognize your initial conclusions were wrong.",
                    "7. Ask for clarification.",
                    "If you know the person who said or did something that made you feel bad, ask for clarification. What did he or she really mean? What was his or her intention? Many times, we interpret situations negatively. But in my experience, after asking for clarification, we realize the other person didn\u2019t intend to hurt us.",
                    "So instead of letting your thoughts spin off in a negative direction, ask the person to spell out what he or she really meant. You may be surprised by the number of times you learn that you completely misread a situation.",
                    "8. Practice self-compassion.",
                    "This is what it all comes down to, isn\u2019t it? Practicing self-compassion when we\u2019re being hard on ourselves. Because even though someone else might say or do something to offend us, we\u2019re the ones who decide how we let their behavior affect us. We can always choose not to take negative comments to heart or get down on ourselves just because someone else was rude or insensitive.",
                    "Practice saying, \u201cI\u2019m not letting that in\u201d to draw a clear line when you\u2019ve decided not to take something personally.",
                    "Whether you misinterpreted a situation or someone actually was rude to you, you decide whether to invite it in or not. So stand guard to the door of your mind. Keep a high standard and make sure to let in words, thoughts, and beliefs that empower and strengthen you.",
